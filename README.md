## About This Fork

This project is a fork of [Vercel's V0 open source chatbot](https://github.com/vercel/ai-chatbot), enhanced by [Papr](https://papr.ai) to incorporate advanced memory capabilities. The Papr Memory SDK allows chatbots to remember past conversations and provide more personalized responses over time.

## Model Providers

This template ships with [xAI](https://x.ai) `grok-2-1212` as the default chat model. However, with the [AI SDK](https://sdk.vercel.ai/docs), you can switch LLM providers to [OpenAI](https://openai.com), [Anthropic](https://anthropic.com), [Cohere](https://cohere.com/), and [many more](https://sdk.vercel.ai/providers/ai-sdk-providers) with just a few lines of code.

## Deploy Your Own

You can deploy your own version of the Next.js AI Chatbot to Vercel with one click:

## Running locally

You will need to use the environment variables [defined in `.env.example`](.env.example) to run Next.js AI Chatbot. It's recommended you use [Vercel Environment Variables](https://vercel.com/docs/projects/environment-variables) for this, but a `.env` file is all that is necessary.

> Note: You should not commit your `.env` file or it will expose secrets that will allow others to control access to your various AI and authentication provider accounts.

### Environment Setup

Your `.env.local` file should include the following variables:

```bash
# Authentication (required)
AUTH_SECRET=your_auth_secret_key

# Database (required)
POSTGRES_URL=your_neon_postgres_url

# File Storage (required)
BLOB_READ_WRITE_TOKEN=your_vercel_blob_token

# AI Provider (one is required)
XAI_API_KEY=your_xai_api_key
# OR
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
# OR another provider

# Memory (optional but recommended)
PAPR_MEMORY_API_KEY=your_papr_memory_api_key
PAPR_MEMORY_UserID_Testing=your_papr_test_userId
```

To set up Papr Memory:
1. Sign up at [app.papr.ai](https://app.papr.ai/)
2. Go to settings -> API key to get your API key
3. Add the API key to your environment variables

### Installation and Running

1. Install Vercel CLI: `npm i -g vercel`
2. Link local instance with Vercel and GitHub accounts (creates `.vercel` directory): `vercel link`
3. Download your environment variables: `vercel env pull`

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```

Your app template should now be running on [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).
